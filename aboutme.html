      <!-- Research statement -->
      <p>
        I am a bioinformatician with a PhD in Evolutionary Genomics, an MSc in Bioinformatics, and a BSc in Microbiology.
        My research integrates high-throughput omics, including RNA-seq, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics,
        with rigorous computational and statistical methods to address questions in evolutionary biology and molecular ecology.
        I work at the interface of comparative genomics and transcriptomics, integrative multi-omics, and machine-learning based
        modelling, with a strong emphasis on reproducibility, scalability, and transparent reporting. A central component of my
        approach is the development and dissemination of robust, reusable bioinformatic workflows and computational tools that
        enable reliable inference from complex biological datasets and support decision-ready analysis in collaborative research environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        My research experience spans multiple biological systems and applied contexts, including projects in neglected tropical diseases
        and plant genomics, where I have contributed to study design, analysis, and interpretation across interdisciplinary teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        For my PhD, I investigate the dynamics of chromosome evolution in termites, focusing on the chromosomal chains that males of many
        species form during meiosis. I am particularly interested in how and why these meiotic chains arise, and whether they are associated
        with elevated rates of structural genome rearrangements. To address these questions, I combine comparative genomics and transcriptomics
        with machine-learning approaches, leveraging large-scale datasets to connect patterns of genome structure with evolutionary and mechanistic hypotheses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alongside research, I am strongly committed to training and capacity building. I have served as a bioinformatics trainer and workshop
        instructor, supervised research projects, and supported collaborators through workflow development, analysis, and manuscript preparation.
        As a postdoctoral researcher, I aim to advance methodologically rigorous, collaborative research while building open, reproducible resources
        that benefit the wider scientific community and translate complex data into clear, actionable insight.
